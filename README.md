GSMA MobileConnect iOS Client Side Library
==============================================================================================================
Mobile Connect is a mobile identity service based on the OpenID Connect & OAuth2 where end users can authenticate themselves using their mobile phone via Mobile Connect. This allows them access to websites and applications without the need to remember passwords and usernames. Itâ€™s safe, secure and no personal information is shared without their permission.

This example client side application demonstrates how to integrate client side library with server side library. Client side includes With Discovery and Without Discovery modes.

Note: if you operate in the EU then you should use EU Discovery Service domain in discovery URL: eu.discover.mobileconnect.io

## Pre-requisites
- Swift 4.0
- Xcode 8

## Quick Start
- Download the Mobile Connect client side library.
- Open project in Xcode.
- Open the configuration file: (ClientSideLib/Config.plist). Here are the following parameters for With Discovery and Without Discovery modes: your server side endpoint for Demo with discovery, your server side endpoint for Demo without discovery, default msisdn, default msisdn for without discovery mode, default mcc, default mnc. Be sure to provide your Server side endpoint or Server side without discovery endpoint to interact with server side SDK. 

Note: you can not change the Server side endpoint while application is running. 

You can also configure your MSISDN, MCC and MNC, IP address for With Discovery App if it's necessary. Also you can configure MSISDN for Without Discovery App. The parameters listed above can be changed while application is running(except Server side endpoints).

- Build the Application.
- With your configuration specified in the configuration file and using user interface, you have everything you need to make a successful call to the server side library by pressing 'Mobile Connect' button.

Note: Your client side library will work only with server side library. Please, see links to the [server side libraries](#resources).
